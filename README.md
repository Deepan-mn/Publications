### [Efficent Appraoch for Multi-Dimensional Closed Sequence Mining](https://github.com/Deepan-mn/Publications/blob/main/Multi_dimensional_sequence_mining_v1.08.pdf)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Developed a novel and scalable algorithm for multi-dimensional sequence mining, integrating CM-ClaSP for closed sequence mining with Bottom-Up Computation for efficient multi-dimensional pattern extraction. Designed the approach to overcome the computational challenges of mining long sequences while preserving valuable insights. Conducted extensive experiments demonstrating the algorithmâ€™s efficiency, scalability, and performance in handling large datasets.

### [A Unified Multimodal Recommendation Framework for Zoho CRM](https://github.com/Deepan-mn/Publications/blob/main/A_Unified_Recommendation_Framework_for_Zoho_CRM%205.pdf)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Developed a unified recommendation framework for Zoho CRM to handle multiple downstream tasks dynamically. The system selects the optimal model from a diverse catalogue, including traditional and attention-based models, using a ranking function powered by a custom data splitter and evaluation metrics. Addressed key challenges such as customization, explainability, and scalability, incorporating a recommendation reasoning model that leverages generative AI for deeper insights into user behavior and preferences. This framework has been successfully integrated as a recommendation builder within Zoho CRM, enhancing decision-making and user engagement.

### Process-and Context-Aware Multi-Agent Framework for Next Best Action Recommendation [Under Review in ECML PKDD 2025](https://ecmlpkdd.org/2025/)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Developed a novel multi-agent framework for Next Best Action (NBA) recommendation that integrates process discovery, Network of Thoughts, and a feedback mechanism to enhance decision-making adaptability. The framework dynamically understands business processes and real-time contexts to provide structured execution plans, reasoning, and insights for each recommended action. By leveraging multi-agent architecture, the system ensures intelligent, personalized, and responsive recommendations, advancing decision intelligence in dynamic business environments.
